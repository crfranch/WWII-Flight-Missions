    <h1>WWII Flight Missions</h1>
     <p>Military aviation during WWII saw major technological advancements and redefined how war was fought from the sky. The Department of Defense released Theater History of Operations for historic aerial bombings from WWI through Vietnam. This analysis looks at WWII flight data. </p>
     <p>The dataset includes an abundance of information including allied countries that carried out the airstrikes, the countries and territorries that were targeted, the aircraft used, and the ordinance used in the strikes.</p>
     <p>Below is an interactive map of the number of missions that targeted each country. In total there were 178,281 missions flown during the war. The United States flew 53% of those missions, followed by Great Britian, New Zealand, then Australia. More than 61,000 missions targeted Germany, specifically Berlin, followed by Italy, France, then Burma, which is now Myanmar. The B17 Bomber flew the majority of the misions (24%). Followed by the B24, B25, A20, then B26.</p>

   <p>The chart below is another representation of the number of times each axis country was targetd. As previously mentioned you can see Germany was the main target for the Allied powers. One interesting find in the data as someone who isn't a WWII historian was there were airstikes carried out on American soil in the Aluetian Islands campaign, which is a territory in Alaska and was part of the Pacific campaign.</p>
